I wish the cook had tasted it before sendong to us. The sesame chicken was bone dry, chewy and tasteless. The rice quality and quantity was also not upto the mark.
With such food quality, this resturant will surely not remain on my choice list.

7,Muhammad,5/5 Stars,20-11-20,"The classic beef burger was great when I had it. I hope you keep the quality and improve even more. 

The critique I have is that the bun to meat ratio is off. The meat diameter is less compared to the bun which can make it feel more bready than meaty. I would recommend adding another 10-20gms to the patty and increasing its diameter.

Otherwise, good stuff. [Add an option for beef/turkey bacon too]

Very pleasant experience otherwise :)",Islamabad

125,MZeeshan,1/5 Stars,14-09-20,Food not upto the mark. I had ordered encourage by recent positive reviews but mine was really bad experience. The fries in shuwarma were stale! Bad experience and would agree with earlier reviews. Please serve fresh food.,Islamabad
125,Azhar,5/5 Stars,09-09-20,It was perfect ! I was a bit confused before ordering as the reviews were quite mixed and some very negative ones. Therefore I found the restaurants number from facebook and then called and asked queries about the Shawarma and the person on the phone was very courteous ... I then placed the order and loved the Shawarma ... I was looking for a taste like the middle east and these ones were like that ..,Islamabad
125,Dina,4/5 Stars,06-09-20,Shawarma is delicious and fresh but the only thing is that they cook with toooo much oil really too much please fix this its really not good I hope you take this seriously,Islamabad
125,Hassan,5/5 Stars,05-09-20,"Read negative reviews but ordered it anyway and turns out this is quite a decent chicken shwarma , arrived hot , fresh ingredients , and tasted authentic. Will order again. Plz add beef to the menu",Islamabad
125,Hareem,5/5 Stars,26-08-20,The best shawarma i have ever had,Islamabad
125,Barika,1/5 Stars,25-06-20,"Soggy, Bland, Greasy, stale & smelly. The size is twice an average shwarma. Does not come in pita bread (i dont mind) because of size ofcourse. The CHICKEN did not look or tasted like shwarma meat. What i least liked and didn't get was why it had raw soggy tomatoes in it?! Nothing else worth the money to mention here.",Islamabad
125,Zaid,3/5 Stars,22-06-20,Too oily and and the shawarma bread was too thin so everything broke apart quickly,Islamabad
125,Sehrish,1/5 Stars,20-06-20,Tasteless,Islamabad
