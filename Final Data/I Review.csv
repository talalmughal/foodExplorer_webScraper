i430,i7,430,7,i,Muhammad,5/5 Stars,20-11-20,"The classic beef burger was great when I had it. I hope you keep the quality and improve even more. 

The critique I have is that the bun to meat ratio is off. The meat diameter is less compared to the bun which can make it feel more bready than meaty. I would recommend adding another 10-20gms to the patty and increasing its diameter.

Otherwise, good stuff. [Add an option for beef/turkey bacon too]

Very pleasant experience otherwise :)",Islamabad
